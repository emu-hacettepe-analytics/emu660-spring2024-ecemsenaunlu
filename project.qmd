# 1. Project Overview and Scope

In this study, the Completed education by province (15+ years old) data set made available by TUIK will be used. It contains data on gender distribution of education levels by province in Turkey between 2011 and 2021.

The population data set will be used to interpret the training data set meaningfully. This data set contains the numbers of women, men and total population in all cities in 2020.

With the 2020 Data set of Convicts Entered into Penal Institutions by Crime Type and Educational Level, crime situations in the provinces will be examined according to education levels in 2020.

With the Gross Domestic Product, 2020 data set, provinces' contribution volume data to the general Turkish domestic national product is kept. With this data set, it is aimed to associate the education data set with the contributions of the provinces to Turkey's gross national product.

## 2.3 Reason of Choice

The change in education level by province in Turkey over the years is an interesting data set. Comments can be made on how the relevant data has changed and developed over the years. For this reason, the changes in Turkey's literacy rates and postgraduate education rates according to provinces and years will be examined in detail.

Additionally, a second data set will be used to examine the relationship between education levels and crime rates. This data set provides us with crimes and crime rates according to education levels in 2020. In addition, it is seen that the 2020 population numbers of the provinces are an important data source for the correct evaluation of the relevant data.

In the yearCrime data set, data on crime rates according to years and education levels is presented. It is aimed to perform time series analysis using relevant data.

In addition, another data set showing the contribution of provinces to Turkey's gross national product will also be used. I estimate that there is a linear relationship between these data and graduate education rates in cities. A regression analysis will be conducted in this direction.

# 2.4 Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing was carried out to edit the Turkish characters in the Turkey data set that we will use on the map, and the uses of K. Maras and KahramanMaras, which are not common with other data sets.

```{r}

library(ggrepel)
library(sf)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(sf)
library(dplyr)
library(rnaturalearth)
library(rnaturalearthdata)

devtools::install_github("ropensci/rnaturalearthhires")

turkey <- ne_states(country = "Turkey", returnclass = "sf")
head(turkey$`name`)

```

# 3. Analysis

We will have many summary data thanks to the data set that will enable us to analyze education levels in Turkey. And we will observe the relationships between them and crime data.

## 3.1 Exploratory Data Analysis

Below you see the graph of the total number of illiterate people in Turkey according to years. From the graph, it can be observed that the number of illiterate people in Turkey has decreased over the years. Stay tuned for many more summary data like this and analysis of the relationships between data.

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)

education <- read_excel("C:/Users/w10/Documents/GitHub/emu660-spring2024-ecemsenaunlu/data/education.xls")


education2 <- education %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarise(illiterateYearTotal = sum(illiterateTotal))


education2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = illiterateYearTotal)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "purple") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Illiterate Total Per Year",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Illiterate Total") +
 theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1),
       axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8))

```

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)

crime <- read_excel("C:/Users/w10/Documents/GitHub/emu660-spring2024-ecemsenaunlu/data/crime.xls")

crime <- crime %>% mutate(CRilliterateTotal = CRilliterateMale + CRilliterateFemale)
crime2 <- crime %>%
  group_by(CRilliterateTotal)


crime2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = `Type of crime`, y = CRilliterateTotal)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "green") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Illiterate Total Per Type Of Crime",
       x = "Type of crime",
       y = "Illiterate Total") +
 theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1),
       axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8))

```

## 3.2 Trend Analysis

First of all, how many doctoral and master's students were in each city in 2020, these statistics will be discussed.

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)

education <- read_excel("C:/Users/w10/Documents/GitHub/emu660-spring2024-ecemsenaunlu/data/education.xls")


education2020 <- education %>% filter(Year == 2020)

education2020 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ProvinceName, y = DoctorateTotal)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "purple") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Doctorate Total per Province in 2020",
       x = "Province",
       y = "Doctorate Total") +
 theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1),
       axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8))

```

## 3.3 Model Fitting

First of all, in Exploratory Data Analysis, it is seen that the training data alone is insufficient to explain the data. For this reason, it was decided to benefit from the population data of 2020. The data on the proportion of people with doctorate and master's degrees in which city are located compared to the population will be examined.

```{r}

library(dplyr)
result <- inner_join(education2020, population, by = "ProvinceName")

DoctorateResult <- result %>%
  mutate(DoctoratePercentage = DoctorateTotal / TotalPopulation * 100 )

Doctorate <- DoctorateResult %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x = ProvinceName, y = DoctoratePercentage), 
           stat = "identity", fill = "blue", position = "dodge") + 
  labs(title = "Distribution of Doctorate Total per Total Population by Province in 2020",
       x = "Province",
       y = "Percentage") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8))


result <- inner_join(education2020, population, by = "ProvinceName")

MasterResult <- result %>%
  mutate(MasterPercentage = MasterTotal / TotalPopulation * 100)

Master <- MasterResult %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x = ProvinceName, y = MasterPercentage), 
           stat = "identity", fill = "purple", position = "dodge") + 
  labs(title = "Distribution of Master Total per Total Population by Province in 2020",
       x = "Province",
       y = "Percentage") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8))

library(gridExtra)

grid.arrange(Doctorate, Master, nrow = 2)
```

We see that Ankara is the province with the highest percentage of people with doctorate and master's degrees in 2020. It seems that the cities in the top 10 list with a high percentage of both master's and doctorate degrees are Ankara, Isparta, Eskişehir, Edirne, Canakkale, Izmir and Istanbul. At the same time, we aim to filter the provinces with the highest number of illiterate people and see if they can be associated with the general structure of the provinces.

```{r}

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(gridExtra)

top_master <- MasterResult %>%
  arrange(desc(MasterPercentage)) %>%
  head(10)

top_doctorate <- DoctorateResult %>%
  arrange(desc(DoctoratePercentage)) %>%
  head(10)

topMaster <- ggplot(top_master) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = reorder(ProvinceName, -MasterPercentage), y = MasterPercentage), 
           stat = "identity", fill = "purple", position = "dodge") + 
  labs(title = "Distribution of the provinces with the highest percentage of master's degrees in 2020",
       x = "Province",
       y = "Percentage") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8))

topDoctorate <- ggplot(top_doctorate) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = reorder(ProvinceName, -DoctoratePercentage), y = DoctoratePercentage), 
           stat = "identity", fill = "pink", position = "dodge") + 
  labs(title = "Distribution of the provinces with the highest percentage of Doctorate's degrees in 2020",
       x = "Province",
       y = "Percentage") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8))


result <- inner_join(education2020, population, by = "ProvinceName")

IlliterateResult <- result %>%
  mutate(IlliteratePercentage = illiterateTotal / TotalPopulation * 100 )

top_illiterate <- IlliterateResult %>%
  arrange(desc(IlliteratePercentage)) %>%
  head(10)


topIlliterate <- ggplot(top_illiterate) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = reorder(ProvinceName, -IlliteratePercentage), y = IlliteratePercentage), 
           stat = "identity", fill = "blue", position = "dodge") + 
  labs(title = "Distribution of the provinces with the highest percentage of Illiterate people in Turkey in 2020",
       x = "Province",
       y = "Percentage") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8))
grid.arrange(topMaster, topDoctorate,topIlliterate, nrow = 3)
```

It is observed that the cities where people with doctorates and master's degrees are concentrated are different from the cities where illiterate people are concentrated.In this context, it can be associated with different data sets and other analyzes can be made.

Based on the above analysis results, analyzes will continue to be made with the prediction that it can be associated with a data set related to Turkey's development level. In this context, the contribution data of the provinces to Türkiye's gross national product will be used. Below, Turkey's contribution rates to the gross national product by province for 2020 are examined. As can be seen, Ankara is among the provinces with the highest contribution. Ankara was also one of the provinces with the highest rates of doctoral and master's degree holders. Based on this data, it comes to mind to examine whether there is a relationship between the high contribution to the gross national product in the provinces with high rates of doctoral and master's degree holders.

```{r}
library(ggrepel)

library(ggplot2)
library(sf)
library(dplyr)
library(rnaturalearth)
library(rnaturalearthdata)

devtools::install_github("ropensci/rnaturalearthhires")

GSYMH2020 <- GSYMH %>% select(ProvinceNames, `2020`)


turkeyChanged <- turkeyChanged[complete.cases(turkeyChanged$featurecla),]
turkeyGSYMH <- inner_join(turkeyChanged, GSYMH2020, by = c("name" = "ProvinceNames"))

ggplot(turkeyGSYMH) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = `2020`), color = "black") +
  geom_sf_text(aes(label = ProvinceNames), size = 1.5, color = "black") +  
  scale_fill_continuous(low = "white", high = "blue", name = "GSYMH2020") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Turkey's Provinces by GSYMH2020",
       subtitle = "GSYMH2020 values for illustration purposes",
       caption = "Source: Generated data") +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        axis.title.y = element_blank(),
        axis.text = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank())

top_GSYMH <- GSYMH2020 %>%
  filter(`2020` > 0) %>%
  arrange(desc(`2020`)) %>%
  head(10)
print(top_GSYMH)

topGSYMH <- ggplot(top_GSYMH) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = reorder(ProvinceNames, -`2020`), y = `2020`), 
           stat = "identity", fill = "blue", position = "dodge") + 
  labs(title = "Distribution of the provinces with the highest GDP of Turkey in 2020",
       x = "Province",
       y = "GDP in 2020") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8))

print(topGSYMH)
```

The ranking of the provinces that contribute the most to Turkey's Gross National Product is given below.

```{r}
top_GSYMH2020 <- turkeyGSYMH %>%
  arrange(desc(`2020`))

top_GSYMH2020 <- top_GSYMH2020 %>%
  select(`ProvinceNames`, `2020`)
print(top_GSYMH2020)
```

As can be seen, Ankara ranks first with the highest GDP contribution. The city with the highest number of people with postgraduate education was Ankara. In this context, the contribution of the high number of people who have completed postgraduate education to the Gross National Product will be investigated.

In this context, we will get support from correlation to examine the relationship between these two situations.

```{r}

correlationTest <- cor.test(top_doctorate$DoctoratePercentage, top_GSYMH$`2020`)


print(correlationTest)

correlation_plot <- ggplot(data = NULL, aes(x = top_doctorate$DoctoratePercentage, y = top_GSYMH$`2020`)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Correlation Doctorate Percentage and GSYMH 2020",
       x = " Doctorate Percentage",
       y = "GSYMH 2020") +
  theme_minimal()

print(correlation_plot)

```

The correlation coefficient took the value of 0.9178788, indicating that there is a very strong positive relationship between these two variables. The p-value is 0.00018, indicating that this correlation is statistically significant. The confidence interval is quite narrow, indicating the accuracy of the correlation. As a result, we can say that there is a very strong and statistically significant positive correlation between DoctoratePercentage and GDP contribution rate variables. This shows that GDP tends to increase as the percentage of PhDs increases.

#3.3.2. Regression Analysis

The analysis here examines whether the gross national product data per capita in 2020 by provinces in Turkey has a relationship with the rates of doctoral graduates in the provinces in the same year.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
GSYMH2020$ProvinceName <- GSYMH2020$ProvinceNames
GSYMH2020 <- GSYMH2020 %>% filter(`2020` > 0)
regressionData <- full_join(GSYMH2020, DoctorateResult, by = "ProvinceName")

model <- lm(`2020`~ DoctoratePercentage, data = regressionData)

summary(model)

plot(regressionData$DoctoratePercentage, regressionData$`2020`,
     main = "The relationship between the GDP percentage of provinces and the rate of people with a doctorate in 2020",
     xlab ="Doctorate Percentage" , ylab = "GDP Percentage", pch = 19, col = "blue")
abline(model, col = "red")

par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(model)

residuals <- resid(model)
residuals_squared <- residuals^2
sum_squared_residuals <- sum(residuals_squared)
n <- length(residuals)

mean_residual_variance <- sum_squared_residuals / n
print(paste("Modelin hata terimlerinin varyansı:", mean_residual_variance))
```

The slope took the value of 0.31138. Each time DoctoratePercentage increases by one unit, the GDP contribution rate variable increases by approximately 0.31138 units. p-value is 0.00048 and this coefficient is highly significant (p-value \< 0.001). R-squared took the value of 0.1674. Approximately 16.74% of the variance in the GDP contribution rate variable is explained by DoctoratePercentage. This suggests that DoctoratePercentage is a significant predictor, but other factors not included in the model also greatly add to the variability. The adjusted R-squared had a value of 0.155. It is slightly lower than the R-squared value and makes the model have low explanatory power. As a result, it can be said that DoctoratePercentage is a significant predictor of the GDP contribution rate variable.

# 3.3.3. Time Series

The relationship between people with postgraduate degrees and the number of crimes committed in Turkey between 2016 and 2020 will be examined.

A time series study was conducted based on the crime rates of people receiving postgraduate education according to years and education levels between 2016 and 2020.

The course of crime processes committed by people with postgraduate education over the years was examined.

According to the analysis results, it was observed that the best method was DGM. The model created predictions of 46.76363, 53.77143, 39.18664, 45.27828, 33.59840 for the next 5-year period. Looking at the graph, it can be said that the data fits well and the predictions are suitable for the structure of the data. It is predicted that if the number of periods were higher, better predictions could be created with different models.

## 3.4 Results

As a result, data sets were examined using correlation, regression analysis and time series analysis. Interesting information was obtained by detecting significant significant relationships and, contrary to expectations, insignificant relationships. In the future, meaningful relationships and prediction studies can be developed by adding new data sets.

# 4. Results and Key Takeaways

In conclusion;

4.1. As predicted, it has been confirmed by both correlation and regression analyzes that the provinces contributing to Turkey's gross domestic product have a linear relationship with education levels.

4.2. According to the 5-year time series analysis conducted with the second data set, which includes the distribution of crime rates by years in education levels, it is concluded that the relevant data are compatible with the model and the crime rates in undergraduate education levels are fixed at an average value in the 5-year period.
